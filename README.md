** This is a collection of Josh's configuration files for his IBM Linux setup.

I got sick of needing to worry about moving machines and setups among my different IBM setups. To get around this particular problem I'm finally going the formal final step to start moving my various setup scripts to a single git project I can download and use whenever I have a new setup that I need to be able to configure to my needs. To avoid duplicate code and maintenance, I'm making sure to pull from public repositories where available. If being on the bleeding edge starts to break things then I expect I'll be moving to certain stable repository states and accepting that I'll have to go throw upgrade hell on occasion.
